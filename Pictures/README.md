# Pictures

## This colder contains pictures of several steps along our development.

- **Version 1**
  - This was the proof of concept airplane, and the only one that successfully flew at all. It was intended to allow us to learn how to make an airplane that could actually fly so that we would have a stable testbed to work off of.

- **Version 2**
  - This was the next iteration of the airplane, featuring a stepped airfoil design that would theoretically allow it to handle better at low speed. However, the extra drag caused by the vortices inherent in a stepped airfoil and heavy weight of the wing meant that the vehicle was unable to fly at all due to insufficient thrust. We were able to successfully test Bluetooth control with this airplane, and all control surfaces and the motor / ESC worked as intended.

- **Version 2 Electronics Bay**
  - This was an easily installable sled that housed the Arduino, battery, motor, and ESC.

- **Version 3**
  - This was the final airplane design, optimized for low weight and a center of gravity in the forward third of the wing for stable control.

- **Version 3 Electronics Bay**
  - The final electronics bay design included structural bulkheads for the battery pack and the Arduino, with a 3/8" wood dowel attaching these bulkheads to the empennage.
